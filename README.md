# C-Internship-Management-System
This is a web-based application built with C# (ASP.NET Core MVC) and SQL Server to streamline the process of managing internships for students, companies, and administrators.

The system allows students to register, browse available internships, and apply directly through the platform. Companies can create accounts, post internship opportunities, and track student applications. Administrators oversee the entire process, approving applications, generating reports, and ensuring data integrity.

✨ Key Features I will be including in my Project:

🔐 Authentication & Role Management – separate access for students, companies, and admins.
📄 Internship CRUD – companies can create, update, and delete internship postings.
📝 Application Workflow – students apply to internships and track their status.
📊 Admin Dashboard – administrators can approve/reject applications and view summary reports.
🗂️ Relational Database – SQL Server backend with properly normalized schema.
💡 Scalable Architecture – built with ASP.NET Core MVC + Entity Framework Core for maintainability.
